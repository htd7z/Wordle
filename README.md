# Wordle by Ty'rese H. â€” March 2022

Wordle game using Python turtle graphics (v2)

* _Use the console to guess a 5-letter word within 6 tries.
* _Black/Gray highlighting means that the letter is not in the word at all.
* _Yellow highlighting means that the letter is in the word, but in the wrong spot.
* _Green highlighting means that the letter is in the word and is in the right spot.

A 2d-list is used to store tuples containing (1) the letter for the box (2) the background color for the box. The draw_box function draws the box, fills it with the right background color, and writes the proper letter on top of it.
